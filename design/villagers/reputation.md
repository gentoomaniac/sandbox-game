# Reputation

- Building too close to NPCs costs reputation with them.
- Reputation changes spread through relationships, **one hop only**:
  - the affected NPC loses reputation with the player;
  - the NPC's direct friends also lose reputation;
  - the NPC's direct enemies gain reputation;
  - the change stops there. This keeps it predictable and explainable to the player.
- **"Too close" means inside a settlement's territory.** The world generator marks
  territory, and building inside it affects that settlement's NPCs. This is a first
  version, to be refined if it feels odd in play.
- Relationships can be between individual NPCs and between groups.
- Ideas for NPCs, their behaviour and LLM dialogue (nothing decided):
